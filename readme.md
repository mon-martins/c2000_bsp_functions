### Notes

- Stack Usage:

When using a RTOS, it's recommended to use the "Stack Usage View" to make sure that all functions called will fit on the space reserved in each Task or Active Object, remember consider to use short sized stack on ISRs because any ISR use the current task's stack, then every task will have stack with a empty space to support any ISR, if you are nesting ISRs you have to be more carefull about this space.
